    <h2>It's not unusual</h2>

    <p>8% of men and 0.5% of women are colourblind to some degree.</p>

    <p>Itera has 7 developers at KLP - three are colourblind.</p>

    <h2>Three main kinds of colourblindness</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Protanope: reduced sensitivity to red light</li>
        <li>Deuteranope: reduced sensitivity to green light (most common)</li>
        <li>Tritanope: reduced sensitivity to blue light (extremely rare)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>True monochrome colour blindness - even rarer.</p>

    <p>Protonopia and deutronopia are commonly called red/green.</p>
</section>

<section class="slide">
    <h2>Protanopes</h2>

    <p>Protanopes are more likely to confuse</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Black with many shades of red</li>
        <li>Dark brown with dark green, dark orange and dark red</li>
        <li>Some blues with some reds, purples and dark pinks</li>
        <li>Mid-greens with some oranges</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Deuteranopes</h2>

    <p>Deuteranopes are more likely to confuse</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Mid-reds with mid-greens</li>
        <li>Blue-greens with grey and mid-pinks</li>
        <li>Bright greens with yellows</li>
        <li>Pale pinks with light grey</li>
        <li>Mid-reds with mid-brown</li>
        <li>Light blues with lilac</li>

    <h2>Tritanopes</h2>

    <p>The most common colour confusions for tritanopes are light blues with greys, dark purples with black, mid-greens
        with blues and oranges with reds.</p>

    <h2>What do children see?</h2>

    <p>Children with normal vision can see the bear, deer, rabbit, and squirrel. They cannot see the fox.</p>
    <p>Children with a red-green color vision deficiency see a cow (instead of the deer), a fox (in the lower left), and
        usually the rabbit and squirrel. They cannot see the bear.</p>

    <h2>So - what can we do about it?</h2>

    <p>Testing apps?</p>

    <p>Many available - but let's look at SimDaltonism - available for both iOS (you can point your camera at things) and
        mac.</p>

<section class="slide">
    <h2>So - what can we do about it?</h2>

    <p>Web tools</p>

    <p>Let's use chrome inspector on a website.</p>

<section class="slide">
    <h2>Summary</h2>

    <p>Hopefully I've given you some idea of my world of colour.</p>

    <p>Luckily for us - helping colour blind people use the web is basically following good universal accessibility
        rules. If we're doing that right then we've already come a long way.</p>

    <p class="next">Oh - and if you ever do find a way to tell me what "red" is - do let me know!</p>

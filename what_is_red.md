## Background

- What colour is that?
- If you know that - how can you be colourblind?
- What does that look like to you?

## It's not unusual

8% of men and 0.5% of women are colourblind to some degree.

In 2017 while I was working at KLP - Itera had 7 developers - three were colourblind.

## Three main kinds of colourblindness

- Protanope: reduced sensitivity to red light
- Deuteranope: reduced sensitivity to green light (most common)
- Tritanope: reduced sensitivity to blue light (extremely rare)

True monochrome colour blindness - even rarer.

Protonopia and deutronopia are commonly called red/green.

## What do children see?

Children with normal vision can see the bear, deer, rabbit, and squirrel. They cannot see the fox.

Children with a red-green color vision deficiency see a cow (instead of the deer), a fox (in the lower left), and usually the rabbit and squirrel. They cannot see the bear.

## So - what can we do about it?

Testing apps?

Many available - but let's look at SimDaltonism - available for both iOS (you can point your camera at things) and mac.

## So - what can we do about it?

Web tools

Let's use chrome inspector on a website.

## Summary

Hopefully I've given you some idea of my world of colour.

Luckily for us - helping colour blind people use the web is basically following good universal accessibility rules. If we're doing that right then we've already come a long way.

Oh - and if you ever do find a way to tell me what "red" is - do let me know!
